## Exploring the Significance and Impact of Home Advantage in Football

### Introduction
The concept of home advantage in sports is a long-standing one: the belief that teams playing on their home turf are more likely to win than their visiting opponents. The reasons are varied and often intangible—ranging from crowd influence and referee bias to travel fatigue and familiarity with the playing surface.

Football, in particular, is renowned for its passionate crowds and emotionally invested fans. In many regions, supporters weave their clubs into their identity and daily life. Matchday atmospheres are electric—filled with chants, songs, and, in some countries, full marching bands. Nowhere is this more evident than in South America, where fan culture is both fierce and iconic. Clubs like Boca Juniors boast legendary supporter groups such as “La 12,” and in Argentina, the absence of away fans combined with the overwhelming presence of home supporters is often cited as a decisive factor in match outcomes.

This study aims to quantify that belief: does playing at home truly offer a measurable advantage? And if so, how significant is it?
